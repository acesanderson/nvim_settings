### What is this folder?
- this contains custom colorschemes I've developed
- the .py file is simply an example script to show the range of highlights
- note: there is also a colorschemes.lua file in plugins folder which has all of the 3rd party plugins
- setting the color scheme for nvim involves uncommenting the relevant line in color.lua
